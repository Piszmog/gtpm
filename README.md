# TPM Plugin Manager (in Go)

This is [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm) reenvisioned in Golang.

## Why?

I spent hours trying to get `tpm` to work but I kept running into errors.

```text
'~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm' returned 127

and

'~/.tmux/plugins/tpm/tpm' returned 1
```

Eventually, I had to do some hacky work arounds to get `tpm` to be happy enough to load my 
plugins.

I was not satified with this and thought I could rewrite it into Go that had better error handling 
and debugging.

### Should I use this?

If `tpm` is working for you, **no**.

If `tpm` is giving you a hard time and you are at the end of your rope, sure give it a spin.
